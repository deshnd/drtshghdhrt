For many software developers, it has been an active threat to our current and future jobs, while we still use it to help us write code. For many other jobs, like cryptocurrency generation and business, it has only been helpful in creating ideas, pictures, and programming. And for artists and writers, it has only been harmful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some advantages of AI include taking risks instead of humans by possibly generating simulations to see what will happen if a decision is made in real life, reducing human errors with tools like autocorrect and grammar-correct, and being available full time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking risks instead of humans could, in the future, allow for AI to elect the president with little help from humans, a literal divine right of kings. The ideal political system could be created. In the future, in order to preserve the rest of Earth, the AI might put us all in simulations of our best dreams living in happiness forever, underground somewhere, while our bodies grow old and eventually die, which would honestly not be a bad life at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing human errors is already happening with autocorrect and tools like Grammarly, but eventually, it&rsquo;s going to be taken to the next level. With enough access to our mind, it will be able to write essays like these for us instantaneously, with no text prompt specifying every small part, or any inconveniences.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI is already available full time, but when the more powerful tools are created and become more accessible, almost every human job will probably be replaced by some form of artificial intelligence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some disadvantages of AI include not giving credit where credit is due, having built in bias (a problem that has been temporarily solved by Mixtral Dolphin), privacy problems, and security risks that can harm millions of people at a time (imagine if all ChatGPT conversations got leaked, along with the full name of the human who was having the conversation connected to each file).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI already has problems with citations, but it&rsquo;s slowly fixing itself. For example, the BingAI, powered by GPT-4, doesn&rsquo;t have that problem that much. It finds sources, but sometimes, it doesn&rsquo;t use the sources it provides, rather referring to the uncited data it was trained on. I think this will get better as time progresses, or we will all eventually live in a society where it doesn&rsquo;t matter who owns what.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI also has problems with built in bias, and even though some models fix this by being completely uncensored currently, I believe that eventually, all AI will tell us is what we want to hear, or what we need to hear for the best possible outcome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Privacy problems and risks are extremely common today, just look up if you&rsquo;ve been PWned, &nbsp;but if things like ChatGPT saved conversations got out, I don&rsquo;t know what a lot of people would do. I, along with many many other people, have gotten unreasonably mad or said some not happy things to ChatGPT, just to see what it would reply with. This could stop many people from getting their dream jobs. I think, eventually, data breaches will be a thing of the past.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I think that AI is a pretty neat thing in our world that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to the day that I can throw myself into an AI-generated world filled with everything I have ever desired and more all to myself until I die. I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people agree that even though that future won&rsquo;t be real/authentic, it would still feel awesome. Also, who&rsquo;s to say this isn&rsquo;t a simulation based on what would happen if monkeys evolved into intelligent life instead of cockroaches?</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Annotated Bibliography</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Marr, B.
